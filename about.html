                            roles – as a teacher, trainer and now a validated licensed
                            educational consultant. I have an MA from Addis Ababa
                            University, Ethiopia. I have also a Post Graduate Certificate in
                            Trainer Development from University of Exeter (College of St.
                            Mark and St. John), UK. Among my many engagements, I have worked
                            with the British Council delivering training to university based
                            curriculum developers on 21st Century Skills and also on the
